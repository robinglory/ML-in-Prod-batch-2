In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer\\n\\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence lengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin 6\\n\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden statesht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved signiﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [ 18] and conditional computation [ 26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc- tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [ 2,16].

Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. •Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2. 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically.

Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required. The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types. As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations.\n",

Segmentation of a 512\\xa0×\\xa0512 image takes less than a second on a modern (2015) GPU using the U-Net architecture.[1][3][4][5] [...] The main idea is to supplement a usual contracting network by successive layers, where pooling operations are replaced by upsampling operators. Hence these layers increase the resolution of the output. A successive convolutional layer can then learn to assemble a precise output based on this information.[1] [...] The network consists of a contracting path and an expansive path, which gives it the u-shaped architecture. The contracting path is a typical convolutional network that consists of repeated application of convolutions, each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a max pooling operation. During the contraction, the spatial information is reduced while feature information is increased.

[...] The U-Net is an architecture that consists of 23 total layers. Using a combination of convolution, up-convolution, pooling and skip connections, the U-Net is able to extract and capture complex features, while also keeping and reconstructing spatial information. This allows for the localisation of features in an image, thus producing accurate segmentation maps. This is especially useful in medical image analysis where accurately locating and detecting abnormalities is vital. [...] For example, the expanded green input above is initially just composed of four 1s. Likewise, the expanded red, yellow and grey regions are initially filled with just 2s, 3s and 4s, respectively. Next, the filter is applied over each of these regions and the results are summed to form the output feature map.\\n\\nIn the U-Net described above, the spatial dimensions were doubled, which means that a 2x2 filter was used with a stride of 2.\\n\\nChanging the Amount of Channels'}, {'url': 'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/u-net-architecture-explained/', 'content': 'The architecture of U-Net is unique in that it consists of a contracting path and an expansive path.

[...] Figure 1 illustrates how the U-Net network converts a grayscale input image of size 572×572×1 into a binary segmented output map of size 388×388×2. We can notice that the output size is smaller than the input size because no padding is being used. However, if we use padding, we can maintain the input size. During the contracting path, the input image is progressively reduced in height and width but increased in the number of channels. This increase in channels allows the network to capture [...] The contracting path in U-Net is responsible for identifying the relevant features in the input image. The encoder layers perform convolutional operations that reduce the spatial resolution of the feature maps while increasing their depth, thereby capturing increasingly abstract representations of the input. This contracting path is similar to the feedforward layers in other convolutional neural networks. On the other hand, the expansive path works on decoding the encoded data and locating the'}, {'url': 'https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/what-is-unet-157314c87634', 'content': 'UNET is a U-shaped encoder-decoder network architecture, which consists of four encoder blocks and four decoder blocks that are connected via a bridge.'}, {'url': 'https://developers.arcgis.com/python/latest/guide/how-unet-works/', 'content': 'U-net was originally invented and first used for biomedical image segmentation.

[...] The UnetClassifier builds a dynamic U-Net from any backbone pretrained on ImageNet, automatically inferring the intermediate sizes. As you might have noticed, U-net has a lot fewer parameters than SSD, this is because all the parameters such as dropout are specified in the encoder and UnetClassifier creates the decoder part using the given encoder.
